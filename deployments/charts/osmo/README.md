# OSMO Helm Chart

The `osmo` chart is the unified OSMO deployment entry point.

The chart defaults are the development quickstart. See the
[profile matrix](profiles/README.md) for production and split-plane overlays.

The chart supports control-only, compute-only, and converged releases. It can
render backend listener and worker resources directly with the control services,
create a PostgreSQL Cluster through CloudNativePG, and deploy Valkey and RustFS.
Split production profiles consume externally managed dependencies and Secrets.
The `self-contained.yaml` production profile instead owns highly available
stateful dependencies and uses retained in-cluster credential generation. The
standalone `backend-operator` chart remains available for existing two-chart
installations, but it is not a dependency of this chart.

## Quick start

The default values are a development-only path to trying the complete OSMO
browser, CLI, API, CPU workflow, and GPU workflow experience in one converged
release. They install:

- the Envoy gateway and browser UI;
- the API, worker, router, logger, agent, and delayed-job monitor;
- the compute backend listener and worker;
- persistent CloudNativePG, Valkey, and RustFS instances;
- generated development credentials, object-storage buckets, configuration,
  service auth, and CPU and GPU platforms in the default pool.

### Prerequisites

Use Kubernetes 1.30 or newer with enough capacity for the resources described
below. Raw Helm installs and upgrades using generated internal TLS require Helm
3.19 or newer so a failed multi-resource bootstrap hook cleans up its earlier
RBAC resources. The cluster must have a default dynamic StorageClass. Install
Helm, `kubectl`, KAI Scheduler, and the CloudNativePG operator before OSMO.
Select the development cluster context once; replace `kind-osmo` if your
cluster has a different context. A GPU workflow also requires GPU-capable nodes
and the NVIDIA GPU Operator.

```bash
kubectl config use-context kind-osmo
kubectl get storageclass

helm upgrade --install kai-scheduler \
  https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler/releases/download/v0.14.0/kai-scheduler-v0.14.0.tgz \
  --namespace kai-scheduler \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m

helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm repo update cnpg
helm upgrade --install cnpg cnpg/cloudnative-pg \
  --version 0.29.0 \
  --namespace cnpg-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

### Install OSMO

Install the chart defaults. Its bootstrap Job creates the shared development
identity directly in Kubernetes. The defaults use `http://127.0.0.1` to
match the quickstart Kind port mapping:

```bash
helm dependency build deployments/charts/osmo
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait \
  --wait-for-jobs \
  --timeout 20m
```

The first installation uses bootstrap Jobs to create the retained
`osmo-master-encryption-key` and `osmo-service-auth` Secrets without putting key
material in Helm state. After that installation succeeds, remove both temporary
Secret-creation permissions and retain the remaining release values:

```bash
helm upgrade osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --reuse-values \
  --set secrets.masterEncryptionKey.bootstrap.enabled=false \
  --set secrets.serviceAuth.bootstrap.enabled=false \
  --wait \
  --timeout 20m
```

Embedded Dex uses volatile memory storage and is intended for development and
evaluation only. Dex restarts invalidate active sessions and signing keys.
Production deployments should use `authentication.provider: externalOidc`.

Inspect the release without reading generated Secret values:

```bash
kubectl --namespace osmo get pods,pvc,services,jobs
kubectl --namespace osmo get service osmo-gateway
```

### Open the UI and use the CLI

The gateway exposes the UI and API on NodePort `30080`, which the quickstart
Kind configuration maps to host port `80`. Open the default URL in a browser:

```bash
export OSMO_URL=http://127.0.0.1
curl --fail "$OSMO_URL/api/version"
```

For another development cluster, set `externalUrl` to the exact URL that its
browser and CLI clients use. For example, to use a port-forward, install with
`--set-string externalUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8080`, then run in one terminal:

```bash
kubectl --namespace osmo \
  port-forward service/osmo-gateway 8080:80
```

Use the same origin for the client:

```bash
export OSMO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The default embedded Dex account signs in as `admin@osmo.local` and appears in
OSMO as `admin`. Configure those fields under
`authentication.bootstrap.identities.admin`. Retrieve its random initial
password only when you need to sign in. This intentionally writes the password
to the terminal, so use a private terminal and do not paste it into shell
history, issue trackers, or logs:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-osmo --namespace osmo get secret osmo-embedded-dex-admin \
  --output jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
printf '\n'
```

Install the CLI if needed, sign in through the browser OIDC flow, and submit the
canonical smoke workflow:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
osmo login "$OSMO_URL"
osmo workflow submit deployments/workflows/verify-hello.yaml \
  --pool default \
  --format-type json
osmo workflow submit deployments/workflows/verify-object-storage.yaml \
  --pool default \
  --format-type json
osmo workflow query <workflow-id> --format-type json
```

Repeat the query until the workflow status is `COMPLETED`.
The workflow runs a small Alpine container, so completion validates CPU
scheduling and backend status reporting.

### Troubleshooting and cleanup

If installation does not become ready, inspect pods, recent events, and the
UI. A `Pending` database, Valkey, or RustFS PVC usually means the cluster has no
working default StorageClass. A `Pending` workflow commonly means KAI is not
healthy or the cluster lacks the workflow capacity described below.

```bash
kubectl --namespace osmo get pods,pvc,jobs
kubectl --namespace osmo get events \
  --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl --namespace osmo logs deployment/osmo-ui
```

Clean up only the quick-start release and namespace:

```bash
helm uninstall osmo --namespace osmo --wait
kubectl delete namespace osmo \
  --wait=true \
  --timeout=10m
```

### Capacity and limitations

The default quickstart runs one replica of every required OSMO service,
including the UI and delayed-job monitor, and uses persistent volumes for
PostgreSQL (1 GiB), Valkey (512 MiB), and RustFS (1 GiB).
PostgreSQL requests 1 CPU and 2 GiB, while Valkey and RustFS each request 500
millicores and 1 GiB. The nine OSMO services request 100 millicores and 256 MiB
each, and the gateway requests 50 millicores and 64 MiB. Those long-running pods
reserve approximately 2.95 CPU and 6.4 GiB before Kubernetes, KAI, and
CloudNativePG operator overhead.

The canonical hello-world pod additionally requests 1 CPU, 1 GiB of memory, and
1 GiB of ephemeral storage for both its user container and its `osmo-ctrl`
container. Ensure an eligible worker has at least 2 CPU, 2 GiB of memory, and
2 GiB of ephemeral storage available for that workflow. The Quickstart disables
MCP, rate limiting, TLS, ingress,
monitoring, autoscaling, disruption budgets, backups, and HA behavior.
Embedded Dex, OAuth2 Proxy, and authorization remain enabled because
control-plane authentication is mandatory.

The Quickstart uses development authentication and exposes an administrator
identity through a NodePort. It is not a production security or availability
configuration. Use a production profile with managed credentials, TLS,
authorization, backups, suitable resource sizing, and HA dependencies for
long-lived environments.

## MCP

Enable MCP on a control-plane release with a public HTTPS Gateway,
identity-provider JWT validation, and semantic authorization. MCP uses the
`mcp` image and mandatory in-process OIDC authentication. The development
quickstart leaves it disabled.
Use the standard component image fields to select a compatible published image.

Follow the [MCP deployment guide](../../../docs/deployment_guide/advanced_config/mcp.rst)
for the shared `services.mcp` overlay, application registration, client-secret
setup, discovery routes, verification, and operations.

This chart uses its existing dependency and credential conventions:

- Enable `planes.control.enabled`. Gateway authentication and authorization
  are mandatory. Embedded Dex is the default identity provider; select
  `authentication.provider: externalOidc` and configure
  `authentication.externalOidc` to use an operator-managed provider.
  Configure the MCP upstream token's matching JWT entry under
  `gateway.envoy.jwt.providers` or `gateway.envoy.jwt.additionalProviders`.
- Redis connection settings follow `embeddedDependencies.valkey` or
  `externalDependencies.valkey`; the password is mounted from
  `secrets.valkey`. For private-CA Valkey TLS, MCP also mounts
  `externalDependencies.valkey.tls.caExistingSecret` using `caKey` and sets
  `SSL_CERT_FILE`. Supply a complete trust bundle, including the public roots
  needed for OIDC HTTPS connections.
- Use `services.mcp.oidcProxy.existingSecret` for the OIDC client secret.
  Change its `rolloutNonce` after rotating that Secret to restart MCP.
  Other injected files use `services.mcp.extraVolumeMounts` with
  `services.mcp.pod.extraVolumes`.
- For a private-CA Gateway, set `services.mcp.gatewayCaFile` to a complete PEM
  trust bundle mounted through those volume settings. This explicitly
  configures Gateway TLS trust; `SSL_CERT_FILE` does not affect Gateway
  requests. Certificate and hostname verification remain enabled.

Readiness uses `/health/ready` to check Redis connectivity with a two-second
deadline. `/health` and `/health/live` only check the running process, so a Redis
outage does not trigger liveness restarts. Readiness does not validate every
OAuth operation or Redis permission. These readiness and Gateway CA settings
require an MCP image containing the corresponding runtime support.

## Single-plane external dependencies

`profiles/single-plane.yaml` is an embedded-Dex-by-default, converged base overlay for
one cluster that runs both the control and compute planes. It disables embedded
PostgreSQL, Valkey, and object storage, while retaining the gateway as a
`ClusterIP` Service. Layer a site-specific values file after it for the public
URL, external dependency connections, and backend name. Ingress is deliberately
an external, later step; enable and configure it only when the site has its
ingress controller and public DNS ready.

The profile configures Envoy to validate supplied OSMO access tokens against the
API service's in-cluster `https://osmo-api/api/auth/keys` endpoint. It requires
JWTs and leaves all default identity headers empty. External identity providers
remain site-specific gateway configuration.

Object storage uses exact `locations` for workflow data, logs, and apps. All
three locations must use the same URI scheme. The URI scheme selects the storage
backend: Azure locations use `azure://<account>/<container>/<prefix>`, while S3
locations use `s3://<bucket>/<prefix>`. GCS uses `gs://<bucket>/<prefix>`.
Non-S3 locations forbid the S3-only
settings in `externalDependencies.objectStorage.s3`; set that block only for S3
locations. Authentication is configured separately:

- `authentication.type: static` is the default. Store credentials for all
  three locations in one pre-provisioned Kubernetes Secret selected by
  `secrets.objectStorage.existingSecret`.
- `authentication.type: sdkDefault` omits static credential mounts and lets the
  provider SDK discover credentials, such as Azure DefaultAzureCredential or the
  AWS default credential provider chain. Leave `secrets.objectStorage.existingSecret`
  empty. GCS currently requires `static` HMAC credentials (`access_key_id` and
  `access_key` in the Secret's YAML document); its backend does not support
  default credentials.

Do not place credential material in values files or Helm command lines.

For example, an Azure site overlay contains only its connection values and
locations:

```yaml
externalDependencies:
  objectStorage:
    authentication:
      type: sdkDefault
    locations:
      workflows: azure://osmoazure/osmo-workflows/workflows
      logs: azure://osmoazure/osmo-workflows/logs
      apps: azure://osmoazure/osmo-workflows/apps
```

An S3 site uses the S3 URI scheme and its S3-specific settings instead:

```yaml
externalDependencies:
  objectStorage:
    authentication:
      type: static
    locations:
      workflows: s3://osmo-workflows/workflows
      logs: s3://osmo-logs/logs
      apps: s3://osmo-apps/apps
    s3:
      region: us-east-1
      overrideUrl: https://s3.example.com
```

Install the generic profile first and a site-specific overlay second:

```bash
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --values deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/single-plane.yaml \
  --values <site-values.yaml>
```

## Self-contained production

The `self-contained.yaml` profile is the production converged path for hosting
OSMO and its stateful dependencies in one Kubernetes cluster. The cluster must
run Kubernetes 1.30 or newer and provide:

- KAI Scheduler;
- the CloudNativePG operator;
- a default dynamic StorageClass;
- a CNI that enforces Kubernetes NetworkPolicy;
- the IPv4 pod and Service CIDRs used by the cluster network; and
- at least four schedulable nodes, with enough failure-domain capacity for
  three PostgreSQL pods, three Valkey pods, and four RustFS pods.

The profile uses embedded Dex by default. The gateway remains a ClusterIP
Service; put an operator-managed TLS edge in front of it and set `externalUrl`
to that public URL. OAuth2 Proxy authenticates requests inside the release,
Envoy strips client-supplied OSMO identity headers, and the OSMO authorization
service enforces role policies. NetworkPolicies prevent in-cluster clients from
bypassing Envoy to reach control-plane Services. See
[Bootstrap identities](#bootstrap-identities) and
[OAuth credentials](#oauth-credentials) to select `externalOidc` instead.
Before production use, run the CNI's NetworkPolicy enforcement smoke test; merely
creating the policy objects does not prove that the cluster enforces them.

Install OSMO with the production profile and the environment-specific inputs:

```bash
kubectl create namespace osmo
helm dependency build deployments/charts/osmo
cp deployments/charts/osmo/examples/self-contained-environment-values.yaml \
  self-contained-environment-values.yaml
# Edit self-contained-environment-values.yaml for the target environment and,
# for production, configure externalOidc and its existing Secret references.
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --values deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/self-contained.yaml \
  --values self-contained-environment-values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --wait-for-jobs \
  --timeout 30m
```

The first installation bootstraps the retained `osmo-master-encryption-key` and
`osmo-service-auth` Secrets without rendering key material. As soon as it
succeeds, disable both bootstrap Jobs in
`self-contained-environment-values.yaml` and apply the mandatory cleanup
transaction:

```yaml
secrets:
  masterEncryptionKey:
    bootstrap:
      enabled: false
  serviceAuth:
    bootstrap:
      enabled: false
```

```bash
helm upgrade osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --values deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/self-contained.yaml \
  --values self-contained-environment-values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 30m
```

The profile deploys these stateful services:

- three PostgreSQL instances with required hostname anti-affinity, a
  PodDisruptionBudget, and synchronous replication to one standby;
- one Valkey primary with two persistent replicas, write-safety checks, and a
  PodDisruptionBudget; and
- four distributed RustFS instances with erasure coding, required hostname
  anti-affinity, a PodDisruptionBudget, and one 100 GiB PVC per instance.

The Valkey dependency provides a fixed-primary replication topology rather than
automatic primary promotion. Plan and test the operator procedure for primary
recovery. Override the storage sizes and StorageClass values for the target
environment before installation when the defaults are not appropriate. Replace
the example cluster CIDR with every pod and Service CIDR used by the target
cluster so workflow egress cannot reach the control-plane Services directly.
The current workflow policy supports IPv4 CIDRs only; IPv6-only and dual-stack
clusters require an environment-specific replacement policy. The chart derives
the RustFS egress namespace and instance selectors from the Helm release while
retaining the TCP port `9000` restriction.

The chart does not configure PostgreSQL WAL archiving or a cross-service backup
system. Before production use, configure an operator-managed snapshot or backup
and restore process for the PostgreSQL, Valkey, and RustFS volumes, and test full
recovery. Replication and erasure coding protect availability; they do not
replace backups.

Check the database, workloads, storage, and Services without reading Secret
values:

```bash
kubectl --namespace osmo wait \
  --for=condition=Ready cluster/osmo-pg --timeout=10m
kubectl --namespace osmo get pods,pvc,services,jobs,poddisruptionbudgets
kubectl --namespace osmo get secret \
  osmo-backend-token osmo-master-encryption-key osmo-valkey-credentials \
  osmo-rustfs-credentials osmo-service-auth osmo-embedded-dex-admin \
  osmo-embedded-dex-oauth
```

The release creates the workflow, log, and app buckets and wires the RustFS
endpoint and credential Secret into the control plane. It creates the retained
backend-token Secret through its bootstrap hook and the retained
master-encryption-key Secret through the explicit lifecycle Job. The generated
values never appear in Helm values, rendered manifests, logs, or Helm release
state. The backend-token hook and object-storage bootstrap Job retain a `50m`
CPU request but intentionally have no CPU limit so their short-lived CLI
processes can use otherwise-idle CPU and finish quickly.

## Embedded PostgreSQL

Embedded PostgreSQL requires CloudNativePG chart `0.29.0` (operator `1.30.0`):

```bash
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --install cnpg cnpg/cloudnative-pg \
  --version 0.29.0 \
  --namespace cnpg-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

Add the following PostgreSQL settings to the environment values used with the
`split-plane-control` profile:

```yaml
embeddedDependencies:
  postgresql:
    enabled: true

externalDependencies:
  postgresql:
    host: ''

secrets:
  postgresql:
    existingSecret: ''
```

Install the chart after the operator is Ready:

```bash
helm dependency build deployments/charts/osmo
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --create-namespace \
  -f deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/split-plane-control.yaml \
  -f <environment-values.yaml> \
  --wait \
  --timeout 25m
```

The split-plane control profile uses production-oriented settings that create
three PostgreSQL 16 instances with one 20 Gi
`ReadWriteOnce` PVC per instance, required hostname anti-affinity, a
PodDisruptionBudget, and synchronous replication to one standby. A generated
application Secret is wired into every OSMO PostgreSQL client automatically.
Leaving `postgresql.cluster.initdb.secret.name` empty lets CloudNativePG create
`<cluster>-app`.
Set `postgresql.cluster.storage.storageClass` when the cluster default is not
the desired durable StorageClass. See the
[CloudNativePG cluster chart](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/charts/tree/cluster-v0.8.0/charts/cluster)
for additional `postgresql` values.

For resource-constrained development, explicitly relax the production settings:

```yaml
postgresql:
  cluster:
    instances: 1
    enablePDB: false
    postgresql:
      synchronous:
        number: 0
        dataDurability: preferred
```

## Install the control plane with external PostgreSQL

Create an environment values file containing the external endpoints and
Secret references:

```yaml
externalUrl: https://osmo.example.com

externalDependencies:
  postgresql:
    host: postgresql.example.com
    port: 5432
    database: osmo
    username: osmo
  valkey:
    host: valkey.example.com
    port: 6379
    database: 0
  objectStorage:
    locations:
      workflows: s3://osmo-workflows/workflows
      logs: s3://osmo-logs/logs
      apps: s3://osmo-apps/apps
    s3:
      region: us-east-1
      overrideUrl: https://s3.example.com

secrets:
  postgresql:
    existingSecret: osmo-postgresql
  valkey:
    existingSecret: osmo-valkey
  objectStorage:
    existingSecret: osmo-object-storage
  masterEncryptionKey:
    managementMode: external
    existingSecret:
      name: osmo-master-encryption-key
      key: mek.yaml
```

For an external PostgreSQL server that supports encrypted connections but for
which no CA trust bundle is available, configure `require` without a CA:

```yaml
externalDependencies:
  postgresql:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      sslMode: require
      caExistingSecret: ''
```

`require` encrypts the PostgreSQL transport but does not authenticate the
server. Prefer `verify-full` whenever server CA trust material is available.
Pre-provision a Secret containing the trust bundle, then select its key:

```yaml
externalDependencies:
  postgresql:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      sslMode: verify-full
      caExistingSecret: osmo-postgresql-ca
      caKey: ca.crt
```

Both modes apply consistently to OSMO services and the database and
service-auth migration Jobs.

Keep `embeddedDependencies.postgresql.enabled: false` as set by the
split-plane control profile, then
install the chart by layering the environment values after the profile:

```bash
helm dependency build deployments/charts/osmo
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo \
  --create-namespace \
  -f deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/split-plane-control.yaml \
  -f <environment-values.yaml> \
  --wait \
  --timeout 25m
```

### Database migrations

For an upgrade backed by an existing external PostgreSQL database, first stop
every legacy OSMO workload or external process that can write PostgreSQL or
initialize database configuration. Disable or suspend every HPA, GitOps
self-heal loop, operator, and other reconciler that could restart or scale
those 6.3 writers, then verify that no legacy writer Pod, Job, or external
process remains. Keep that fence in place while the migration hook runs and
until the upgraded manifests are applied. If the hook or manifest application
fails, keep the 6.3 writers stopped; resume only workloads verified to use the
6.4 image and configuration. This requirement applies equally to raw Helm and
Argo CD; Argo CD is not required. Complete the 6.3-to-6.4
[legacy-writer quiescence fence](../../upgrades/6_3_to_6_4_upgrade.md#legacy-writer-quiescence-fence)
and [backup prerequisite](../../upgrades/6_3_to_6_4_upgrade.md#backup-before-destructive-cleanup)
before enabling the pgroll hook in the environment values:

```yaml
databaseMigration:
  enabled: true
  targetSchema: public
```

The chart loads the ordered OSMO 6.4 migration JSON files from `migrations/`
and runs them before OSMO workloads start. Hook ordering and cleanup use Helm
annotations as the single source of truth. Raw Helm executes them directly;
Argo CD maps the supported Helm hook annotations and weights to `PreSync` hooks
and sync waves. Do not mix explicit `argocd.argoproj.io/hook` annotations into
the same Argo CD Application because Argo CD then ignores Helm hooks. Use the
reconciliation path that manages the release. The source database must already
have the OSMO 6.3 schema; upgrades from earlier releases must first use the
applicable legacy service-chart migrations. The migration reads the same
PostgreSQL Secret key as the services and runs before the service-auth database
migration. It downloads the pinned pgroll release from GitHub at runtime, so
the Job requires outbound HTTPS access to GitHub.

Use `public` to migrate the base schema in place. A versioned target such as
`public_v6_4_0` also injects `OSMO_SCHEMA_VERSION` into each PostgreSQL consumer;
keep `databaseMigration.enabled` set while those workloads use that schema.
Migration hooks are not supported with embedded PostgreSQL because Helm
pre-install hooks run before the embedded database cluster exists.

## Install a split compute plane

The `split-plane-compute.yaml` profile installs only the backend listener,
worker, and their Kubernetes access. It does not render control services,
PostgreSQL, Valkey, RustFS, or credentials. Before installing, provision the
referenced Secret in the compute release namespace. Its `token` key must contain
the current 43- or 64-character URL-safe backend token; `previous-token` may
contain a distinct old token during rotation.

Copy the profile and replace its example `externalUrl` and
`compute.authentication.existingSecret` values, then install it with an
explicit backend name. Each compute release attached to the same control plane
must use a unique name.

```bash
helm dependency build deployments/charts/osmo
helm --kube-context <compute-context> upgrade --install osmo-compute \
  deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace osmo-compute \
  --create-namespace \
  --values <compute-values.yaml> \
  --set-string compute.backendName=<backend-name> \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

An empty `compute.workloadNamespace.name` resolves to the Helm release
namespace. Set `compute.workloadNamespace.create=true` only for a distinct
namespace that the chart should create and retain. This is the WDP-01/WDP-02
boundary: a compute-only release uses `externalUrl` to reach the external
control plane and consumes
`compute.authentication.existingSecret` from its release namespace. Change
`compute.authentication.tokenKey` when the token is stored under a non-default
Secret key. The release has no dependency on Vault-agent annotations or
control-plane workloads.

In a converged release, listener and worker instead use the release gateway
Service DNS and port. They start concurrently with the control plane and rely
on their normal connection retries rather than a chart-managed startup gate.
They do not hairpin through `externalUrl`; that value remains the public URL
used by clients and control-plane configuration.

## Embedded Valkey

The quickstart defaults enable a small embedded Valkey. A profile that disables
it can enable it with retained generated credentials as follows:

```yaml
embeddedDependencies:
  valkey:
    enabled: true

externalDependencies:
  valkey:
    host: ''

secrets:
  valkey:
    generate: true
    existingSecret: ''
```

The generated Secret and configured `ReadWriteOnce` PVC are retained on
uninstall. The quickstart uses 512 MiB; the split-plane control profile uses
8 GiB when embedded Valkey is enabled there.
Back up both resources and restore the original Secret before reinstalling or
recovering the PVC. To supply an existing Secret instead, disable
`secrets.valkey.generate` and set both `secrets.valkey.existingSecret` and
`valkey.auth.usersExistingSecret` to its name. An existing Secret is recommended
for production and GitOps installations. Generated credentials are retained in
the Kubernetes Secret and Helm release history; restrict access to both and use
`--hide-secret` when previewing an install or upgrade.

The default standalone primary uses append-only persistence and a `Recreate`
upgrade strategy. Kubernetes restarts a failed primary and reattaches its PVC;
Valkey-backed OSMO operations are unavailable until it becomes Ready. Take a
storage snapshot before upgrades and follow the CSI provider's guidance for
volume expansion. Replication is available through
`valkey.replica.enabled=true`, but the primary remains fixed and is not
automatically failed over. Standalone and replication use different persistent
storage layouts. OSMO does not manage topology migrations, so review the
[official Valkey chart documentation](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-helm/tree/main/valkey#deployment-modes)
before changing `valkey.replica.enabled`. Use an external Valkey service for
automatic primary promotion, multi-zone failover, managed backups, or TLS.

To use external Valkey, keep `embeddedDependencies.valkey.enabled=false` and
configure `externalDependencies.valkey` and
`secrets.valkey.existingSecret` as shown in the installation example.

## Embedded RustFS object storage

Enable embedded object storage with retained generated credentials as follows:

```yaml
embeddedDependencies:
  objectStorage:
    enabled: true

externalDependencies:
  objectStorage:
    locations:
      workflows: ''
      logs: ''
      apps: ''
    s3:
      region: ''
      overrideUrl: ''

secrets:
  objectStorage:
    generate: true
    existingSecret: ''

rustfs:
  secret:
    existingSecret: osmo-rustfs-credentials
```

The split-plane control profile deploys a standalone RustFS instance with a
retained 10 GiB `ReadWriteOnce` PVC when embedded object storage is enabled.
A regular Job waits for RustFS and creates the configured workflow, log, and
app buckets when they are absent. Use `--wait-for-jobs` with Helm so an install
or upgrade does not return before bucket bootstrap succeeds. OSMO is configured
with the RustFS endpoint, buckets, and generated credentials automatically.

The generated `osmo-rustfs-credentials` Secret is retained on uninstall and
reused on upgrades. To provide an existing Secret, disable
`secrets.objectStorage.generate` and set both
`secrets.objectStorage.existingSecret` and
`rustfs.secret.existingSecret` to its name. The Secret must contain
`RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY`, `RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY`, and `object-storage.yaml`; the
credentials in all three entries must match. Use a unique Secret name for each
OSMO release in the same namespace. Generated RustFS credentials are also
stored in Helm release history; restrict access to it and use `--hide-secret`
when previewing an install or upgrade.

For a distributed deployment, layer
[`embedded-rustfs-ha-values.yaml`](embedded-rustfs-ha-values.yaml) after the
environment values and provide the existing Secret referenced by that file.

To use external object storage, keep
`embeddedDependencies.objectStorage.enabled=false` and configure
`externalDependencies.objectStorage` and
`secrets.objectStorage.existingSecret` as shown in the installation example
above.

## Optional configuration

- Configure the OSMO image registry, base repository, and tag under
  `imageRegistry`, `imageRepository`, and `imageTag`; they default to
  `nvcr.io`, `nvidia/osmo`, and `latest`. A non-empty service-specific
  `image.registry`, `image.repository`, or `image.tag` takes precedence over
  the corresponding top-level value. Runtime workflow image fields under
  `runtimeImage` are optional overrides and inherit the matching top-level
  value when empty. Otherwise the chart uses `nvcr.io/nvidia/osmo` and the
  component name. The chart writes the resolved workflow images into the
  managed API configuration unless `configuration.workflow.backend_images`
  overrides them. Configure dependency images and pull credentials in their
  native values blocks; for example, Valkey uses `valkey.image` and
  `valkey.imagePullSecrets`.
- Configure replicas, autoscaling, resources, disruption budgets, scheduling,
  security contexts, probes, volumes, and ServiceAccounts under `services`,
  `gateway`, and `podDefaults`. Directly owned workload extensions use
  `extraEnv`, `extraArgs`, `extraVolumeMounts`, `pod.initContainers`,
  `pod.extraContainers`, and `pod.extraVolumes`. Configurable probes use an
  `enabled` switch and a raw Kubernetes probe under `spec`.
- Configure per-Service labels and annotations under each component's
  `service` block. Service ports and names that wire chart components together
  remain chart-managed.
- Configure compute-wide workflow namespace, compute token identity, authentication
  Secret, RBAC, namespace-wide workflow network policy, and priority classes
  under `compute`.
  Listener, worker, and test-runner workload settings live under
  `services.backendListener`, `services.backendWorker`, and
  `services.backendTestRunner`.
- Enable Prometheus Operator PodMonitors independently with
  `monitoring.podMonitor.control.enabled` and
  `monitoring.podMonitor.compute.enabled`. Shared scrape settings apply to both
  planes and cover only OSMO-owned pods.
- Apply shared resource metadata to OSMO-owned resources with `commonLabels`
  and `commonAnnotations`. Component metadata overrides shared user metadata;
  chart-protected identity labels and annotations take final precedence.
  Configure dependency metadata in the dependency's native values block.
- Configure hook and init-container images with their image objects under
  `secrets.masterEncryptionKey.bootstrap.image`,
  `embeddedDependencies.objectStorage.bootstrap.image`, and
  `services.backendTestRunner.initContainer.image`. Digest references take
  precedence over tags, and all directly owned Pods use `imagePullSecrets`.
  Identity bootstrap deliberately uses the resolved `services.api.image` and
  does not have a separate image setting.
- Supply OSMO application configuration under `configuration`.

See [`values.yaml`](values.yaml) for the complete configuration reference.

## Compute resource ownership

Binary defaults are not duplicated as individual Helm values. Override
listener, worker, or test-runner command-line tuning with the component's
`extraArgs`. `services.backendListener.enableNodeLabelUpdate` remains explicit
because enabling it also grants the listener permission to patch Node labels.

`compute.rbac.create=false` disables all chart-owned compute Roles and
RoleBindings in the workflow and test namespaces. Cluster RBAC is controlled
separately. When namespaced RBAC is chart-owned but cluster policy is centrally
managed, set `compute.rbac.clusterRoles.create=false` and provide `listenerName`,
`workerName`, and, when the test runner is enabled, `testRunnerName` under
`compute.rbac.clusterRoles`. Chart-owned cluster RBAC names include a stable
hash of the Helm release namespace so equal release names in different
namespaces do not collide.

`compute.workflowNetworkPolicy` owns a namespace-wide egress policy for every
Pod in `compute.workloadNamespace.name`; it is not limited to OSMO Pods.
Enabling it requires one or more `clusterCIDRs`, unless
`allowAllClusterEgress=true` explicitly acknowledges unrestricted cluster
egress. Use `allowedNamespaces` and `additionalEgressRules` for environment
specific destinations.

`compute.priorityClasses.create` controls ownership of the fixed
`osmo-high`, `osmo-normal`, and `osmo-low` PriorityClasses consumed by workflow
Pods. Only one release in a cluster should create them; other compute releases
must set `create: false`.

## Bootstrap identities

`authentication.bootstrap.identities` is a map so values overlays add entries
without replacing the default `admin` or `backend-operator-default` entries.
An identity may have a Dex password, one or more OSMO login tokens, or both. An
email is required only for Dex local login and does not grant any OSMO role.
For each role assigned to a Dex-enabled identity, the corresponding
`configuration.roles.<role>.external_roles` must be exactly `[<role>]`. This
keeps embedded-Dex users on the existing external-role synchronization path;
the default roles already use this mapping. Compute-plane authentication must
reference a token identity whose only role is `osmo-backend`.

This example appends a developer with both login methods and two independently
audited compute token identities. Add further map entries in the same form
when ten or more compute credentials are needed:

```yaml
authentication:
  bootstrap:
    identities:
      developer:
        enabled: true
        username: developer
        roles: [osmo-user]
        dex:
          enabled: true
          email: developer@osmo.local
        tokens:
          cli:
            managedSecret:
              name: osmo-developer-token
      backend-east:
        enabled: true
        username: backend-east
        roles: [osmo-backend]
        tokens:
          primary:
            managedSecret:
              name: osmo-backend-east-token
      backend-west:
        enabled: true
        username: backend-west
        roles: [osmo-backend]
        tokens:
          primary:
            existingSecret:
              name: osmo-backend-west-token
              key: token
```

Multiple tokens under one identity authenticate as the same username but have
different token names for audit. Separate compute token identity entries
produce distinct usernames. Set an inherited entry's `enabled: false` to
disable it.
For external OIDC, disable the default local user and configure the provider;
Secret-backed user and backend tokens remain available:

```yaml
authentication:
  provider: externalOidc
  bootstrap:
    identities:
      admin:
        enabled: false
```

Managed credentials are generated with Python's cryptographic `secrets`
module. Dex hashes use bcrypt cost 12. The Job creates one plaintext password
Secret per Dex user, one Secret per managed token, a shared OAuth Secret, and a
hash-only Dex environment Secret. It preserves valid owned Secrets across
install and upgrade, including declarative Helm or Argo CD reconciliation.
Helm rollback changes declarations but does not roll credential bytes back.
Helm uninstall does not delete the API-created Secrets.

Retrieve a credential only in a private terminal. For example:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-osmo --namespace osmo get secret osmo-embedded-dex-admin \
  --output jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
printf '\n'
```

To rotate one managed password or token, delete only that exact Secret and run
the next Helm/GitOps reconciliation. Deleting the OAuth Secret rotates both the
browser client and cookie secrets. A Dex password rotation also reconciles the
hash-only aggregate and restarts the affected authentication Pods. Older
`authentication.embeddedDex.admin`, credential-generation fields, and
`secrets.backendApiTokens` values are removed. Revoke
any legacy database-backed default-admin token after validating its replacement.

## Secrets

The same Kubernetes Secret may satisfy several logical blocks, or each block
may reference a separate Secret. The defaults expect these keys:

| Values block | Default key | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secrets.postgresql` (external) | `db-password` | PostgreSQL clients |
| `secrets.valkey` | `redis-password` | Valkey clients |
| `secrets.objectStorage` | `object-storage.yaml` | Workflow data, logs, and apps |
| `secrets.masterEncryptionKey` | `mek.yaml` | OSMO encryption-key configuration |
| `secrets.serviceAuth` | `authentication-config.json` | Stable JWT signing identity |
| `authentication.bootstrap.identities.*.tokens.*` | `token`, optional `previous-token` | User or backend bootstrap authentication |
| `osmo-embedded-dex-<identity-id>` | `password`, `password-hash` | Retained embedded-Dex user credential |
| `osmo-embedded-dex-oauth` | `browser-client-secret`, `cookie-secret` | Retained browser OAuth and session-cookie credentials |
| `osmo-embedded-dex-password-hashes` | bcrypt hashes for current and previously configured Dex users | Dex runtime input; contains no plaintext passwords; historical hashes are retained so failed upgrades can roll back safely |
| `authentication.externalOidc.*Secret` | Configured key | Operator-owned external OIDC credentials |

External object-storage locations may use `s3://`, `gs://`, `azure://`, or `swift://`
URIs, but all three locations must use the same scheme. The usual static
credential form stores one YAML document in `secrets.objectStorage.existingSecret`.
To reuse separate per-location Secrets, leave `existingSecret` empty and set
all three `secrets.objectStorage.credentialSecretRefs`. An empty reference
`key` loads the Secret's individual data keys; a non-empty key selects one YAML
credential document. When every referenced Secret supplies its own `endpoint`,
all three `externalDependencies.objectStorage.locations` may be empty; the
rendered configuration then takes the endpoints only from the Secrets. Either
configure all three locations or leave all three empty. Do not configure both
Secret forms.

Generated identity-token, embedded-Dex, MEK, and service-auth Secrets are intentionally
retained because replacing them can disconnect the compute plane, make
encrypted database fields unreadable, or invalidate the installation's signing
identity. Identity credentials are reconciled by a short-lived Job from the API
service image, and credential bytes are never rendered into Helm manifests or
logged. The non-secret identity ConfigMap records only usernames, roles, and
Secret keys. Back up generated Valkey and RustFS Secrets with their PVCs.

`helm uninstall osmo --namespace osmo` removes release-owned workloads but does
not make retained credentials or data safe to discard. Inspect and back up
retained Secrets and PVCs before deleting the namespace. CloudNativePG database
retention follows the operator and cluster settings. Uninstall the CNPG operator
only after all managed PostgreSQL Clusters have been handled.
When `compute.workloadNamespace.create=true`, Helm also retains that Namespace
and its workflow NetworkPolicy. The retained policy must be deleted manually if
it is later disabled; delete the namespace only after its workflow resources
and data are no longer needed.

To use an existing embedded PostgreSQL credential Secret, provide a
`kubernetes.io/basic-auth` Secret whose `username` matches
`postgresql.cluster.initdb.owner`, then set:

```yaml
postgresql:
  cluster:
    initdb:
      secret:
        name: osmo-postgresql-credentials
```

### Service auth identity

Service auth contains the installation's JWT private key. The chart mounts the
Secret referenced by `secrets.serviceAuth.existingSecret` into every consumer.
Quickstart defaults and `self-contained.yaml` create it automatically with a
Kubernetes-only bootstrap Job. The Job uses the configured OSMO API service
image and has create-only access to Secrets; retries only preserve an existing
Secret after validating its ownership, digest, and key pair.

Single-plane, split-plane, and existing installations use
`managementMode: external`. Create their Secret before install:

```bash
OSMO_SERVICE_AUTH_DIRECTORY="$(mktemp -d)"
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --entrypoint service-auth-bootstrap \
  --volume "${OSMO_SERVICE_AUTH_DIRECTORY}:/output" \
  <service-image> \
  generate --output /output/authentication-config.json
kubectl create secret generic osmo-service-auth --namespace <namespace> \
  --from-file="authentication-config.json=${OSMO_SERVICE_AUTH_DIRECTORY}/authentication-config.json"
rm "${OSMO_SERVICE_AUTH_DIRECTORY}/authentication-config.json"
rmdir "${OSMO_SERVICE_AUTH_DIRECTORY}"
```

Quickstart and self-contained are install-only profiles. After bootstrap,
disable `bootstrap.enabled` to remove its Job and RBAC. Use the migration below
for an older DB-backed identity.

For an existing PostgreSQL-backed installation, first establish a maintenance
window using the full
[legacy-writer quiescence fence](../../upgrades/6_3_to_6_4_upgrade.md#legacy-writer-quiescence-fence).
That fence must already prevent every 6.3 database writer and its automation
from returning. In addition, verify specifically that the old configuration API
cannot change `service_auth`; scaling only this API is not a substitute for the
full database-migration fence. Replace the example release and namespace if
needed.

```bash
OSMO_RELEASE_NAME=osmo
OSMO_NAMESPACE=osmo
OSMO_API_SELECTOR="app.kubernetes.io/instance=${OSMO_RELEASE_NAME},app.kubernetes.io/component=api"
OSMO_API_DEPLOYMENT="$(kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" get deployment \
  --selector "${OSMO_API_SELECTOR}" \
  --output=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')"
test -n "${OSMO_API_DEPLOYMENT}"
kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" delete hpa \
  --selector "${OSMO_API_SELECTOR}" --ignore-not-found
kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" scale deployment \
  "${OSMO_API_DEPLOYMENT}" --replicas=0
kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" rollout status deployment \
  "${OSMO_API_DEPLOYMENT}" --timeout=5m
if kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" get pods \
  --selector "${OSMO_API_SELECTOR}" \
  --output=name | grep -q .; then
  echo "old API pods still exist; do not continue" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

With writers stopped, pre-provision an empty Secret and authorize it for the
exact Helm release:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic osmo-service-auth \
  --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}"
kubectl annotate secret osmo-service-auth \
  --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" \
  "osmo.nvidia.com/service-auth-db-migration-placeholder=${OSMO_RELEASE_NAME}"
```

The candidate 6.4 configuration must be deployed in two separate chart syncs.
For the first sync, use the complete candidate values and immutable image
digests with `services.api.enabled=false`,
`secrets.serviceAuth.existingSecret.name=osmo-service-auth`, and
`secrets.serviceAuth.migration.enabled=true`. Keeping the API disabled is the
enforced submission boundary while the ConfigMap and every other consumer are
replaced. A Helm pre-upgrade or Argo CD PreSync Job reads and
decrypts the legacy DB identity, validates every public/private keypair, and
writes canonical plaintext JSON into the authorized placeholder. It then reads
the DB identity again and aborts if the stable authority changed during the
migration. An already populated Secret is preserved only when its complete
stable identity matches. Temporary hook RBAC grants only `get` and `update` on
that named Secret and is removed after the hook completes.

This Job is opt-in transitional upgrade compatibility for installations coming
from DB-backed releases. It remains disabled by default and should stay in the
chart until direct upgrades from those releases are no longer supported. It
copies and validates the existing stable identity; it does not create or rotate
an identity and does not create a persistent runtime component.

After the first sync succeeds, wait for every enabled non-API ConfigMap consumer
(worker, logger, agent, and gateway-authz) to finish rolling out. Confirm the API
Deployment and HPA are absent and the API selector still returns no pods. Do not
continue if any consumer is unavailable.

```bash
OSMO_CONFIG_CONSUMER_SELECTOR="app.kubernetes.io/instance=${OSMO_RELEASE_NAME},app.kubernetes.io/component in (worker,logger,agent,gateway-authz)"
for deployment in $(kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" get deployment \
  --selector "${OSMO_CONFIG_CONSUMER_SELECTOR}" --output=name); do
  kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" rollout status \
    "${deployment}" --timeout=10m || exit 1
done
for resource in deployment horizontalpodautoscaler pod; do
  if kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" get "${resource}" \
    --selector "${OSMO_API_SELECTOR}" --output=name | grep -q .; then
    echo "API ${resource} still exists; do not enable submissions" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

Run a second chart sync with the exact same candidate ConfigMap and image
digests, `services.api.enabled=true`, and
`secrets.serviceAuth.migration.enabled=false`. The Secret-backed API can start
only in this second phase, after all other consumers have validated the same
snapshot. Wait for it to become ready and confirm that Helm has recreated its
HPA when autoscaling is enabled. Argo CD users must commit and health-gate these
as two distinct revisions; auto-promotion between phases is unsafe.
After the second revision is Healthy and the live smoke test passes, restore
the installation's normal automated sync policy. If reconciliation cannot be
suspended or an in-flight operation cannot be drained, the cutover is blocked.

Retain the legacy DB row and its MEK through the rollback window so an older
binary can still use the same identity; 6.4 runtime services ignore that row.

To retry a failed or interrupted migration, correct the cause and rerun the
Helm upgrade or start another Argo CD sync. The stable hook name and
before-creation cleanup policy recreate the Job. Deleting an Argo hook alone
does not start a new sync because hooks run as part of sync operations.

```bash
kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" rollout status deployment \
  "${OSMO_API_DEPLOYMENT}" --timeout=10m
kubectl --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" get hpa \
  --selector "${OSMO_API_SELECTOR}"
```

The migration uses `secrets.masterEncryptionKey` to decrypt legacy MEK/JWE
values. Missing, malformed, changing, or mismatched identity data fails closed
without generating a replacement key. `login_info` remains deployment-derived
and is overlaid only in memory.

Intentional key rotation requires a staged keyset rollout: add the new key,
roll all consumers, switch `active_key`, retain the old verification key until
all tokens it signed have expired, and remove it in a later rollout. Change
`rolloutNonce` on each Secret update.

The MEK is mounted through the typed
`secrets.masterEncryptionKey.existingSecret.{name,key}` reference. Set
`managementMode: external` for an operator-owned read-only Secret. Set
`managementMode: osmo` when this release should create and update that exact
Secret through explicitly requested lifecycle Jobs. With
`managementMode: osmo` and `bootstrap.enabled: true`, the Secret does not need
to exist before the first installation; the bootstrap Job creates it without
exposing key material to Helm.

For a disposable install backed by a new database, enable `bootstrap`. Helm
renders no MEK Secret data. A namespace-scoped create-only lifecycle Job waits
for PostgreSQL, proves that the database has no users or UEKs, verifies that
every chart consumer is blocked before its writer
container starts, and atomically creates the full Secret. Key material never
enters Helm output or release state. A retry accepts only the exact Secret owned
by this installation and authenticates the retained database before succeeding;
it never overwrites or deletes a Secret. Non-chart database writers must be
stopped for initial bootstrap.

Before rotating the MEK, commit and sync
`secrets.masterEncryptionKey.bootstrap.enabled: false`. The chart rejects a
rotation phase while bootstrap remains enabled. For Helm, disable bootstrap in
a separate upgrade before setting `rotation.phase`:

```bash
helm upgrade osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --namespace "${OSMO_NAMESPACE}" \
  --reuse-values \
  --set secrets.masterEncryptionKey.bootstrap.enabled=false \
  --wait \
  --timeout 20m
```

If bootstrap fails or its database credentials are corrected under Argo CD or
Flux, increment the non-secret `bootstrap.attempt` before syncing again; this
creates a new immutable retry Job without deriving public names from credential
bytes.

Every consumer loads its keyring once at process startup. Before becoming
ready, it performs a bounded authenticated inventory of every UEK wrapper. It
then logs one machine-readable
`OSMO_MEK_DESCRIPTOR` containing only the current key ID, loaded key IDs,
generation, and non-secret bundle digest. There are no MEK database tables,
triggers, polling loops, or hot reloads.

The 6.4 runtime does not treat legacy `configs` rows as MEK persistence;
the ordered database migration handles those compatibility rows before
rollout. A MEK inventory blocker therefore indicates a UEK-wrapper,
key-material, or ciphertext failure. Restore the required MEK/key material and
investigate the named authentication failure; do not automatically generate,
replace, or rotate the service identity or MEK.

Rotation is an explicit three-phase operation. Use one unique request ID for
the whole rotation and keep every previous key in the Secret:

1. Set `rotation.phase=prepare`. The managed Job adds exactly one key and leaves
   `currentMek` unchanged. After the Job succeeds, clear the phase, change
   `rotation.rolloutRevision`, and sync again to roll every consumer.
2. Set `rotation.phase=activate`. The Job first verifies that the complete,
   Ready Pod cohort belongs to the expected Deployments and logged the PREPARE
   descriptor, then selects the new key. Clear the phase, change
   `rolloutRevision` again, and sync to perform the second rollout.
3. Set `rotation.phase=rewrap`. The Job verifies the ACTIVATE cohort, then
   compare-and-swap rewraps all UEKs from the beginning and runs two
   authenticated inventories. Clear the phase
   after success.

For example, the same values changes work with Helm upgrades or separate Argo
CD syncs:

```yaml
secrets:
  masterEncryptionKey:
    managementMode: osmo
    existingSecret:
      name: osmo-master-encryption-key
      key: mek.yaml
    bootstrap:
      enabled: false
      attempt: "1" # increment only to retry a failed bootstrap
    rotation:
      requestId: rotate-2026-08-21
      phase: prepare       # then "", activate, "", rewrap, ""
      rolloutRevision: "1" # change to "2" after PREPARE and "3" after ACTIVATE
```

Each Job creates or reuses a release-scoped Kubernetes Lease directly. The
Lease is intentionally absent from Helm desired state, so GitOps self-heal
cannot clear a live holder. A Lease held by another attempt is never stolen,
even after its timestamp expires. If an attempt dies, delete its old Job/Pod,
verify it is gone, clear the Lease holder, increment `rotation.attempt`, and
retry the same phase. Jobs never delete Pods or patch Deployments; Helm or the
GitOps controller owns both rollouts. Clear a completed phase promptly so its
narrowly scoped ServiceAccount and RoleBinding leave the desired state.

With `managementMode: external`, the operator performs PREPARE and ACTIVATE by
updating the existing Secret, with one rollout after each update. Then set only
`rotation.phase=rewrap`. The rewrap Job has exact-name Secret `get` permission,
not `patch` or `update`, and enforces the same ACTIVATE Pod attestation before
touching ciphertext.

Rewrap completion is point-in-time evidence, not permission to remove an old
key. Because this design deliberately has no database write fence, all old MEKs
remain mandatory. User plaintext and UEK key material do not change; only their
encrypted wrappers change. Normal application reads never perform MEK rewrap
writes; the explicit Job is the sole orchestrator.

For an external Valkey endpoint signed by a public CA, enable
`externalDependencies.valkey.tls.enabled` and leave `caExistingSecret` empty to
use the image's system trust store. For a private CA, set `caExistingSecret` and
`caKey` in the same block. The selected key must contain the complete trust
bundle because clients use it through `SSL_CERT_FILE`. PostgreSQL private CAs
are also configured in its `externalDependencies` TLS block.

Secret references may share one Kubernetes Secret or use separate Secrets.
After rotating an external Secret, change its `rolloutNonce` to restart
consumers.

### OAuth credentials

In embedded-Dex mode, the identity bootstrap hooks create and retain the local
user, browser-client, and cookie credentials; see
[Bootstrap identities](#bootstrap-identities). In
external-OIDC mode, client and cookie credentials are operator-owned and may
share a Secret:

```yaml
authentication:
  externalOidc:
    browserClientSecret:
      existingSecret: osmo-external-oidc
      key: client_secret
      rolloutNonce: ''
    cookieSecret:
      existingSecret: osmo-external-oidc
      key: cookie_secret
      rolloutNonce: ''
```

By default, OAuth sessions use `externalDependencies.valkey.database`. Set
`gateway.oauth2Proxy.redisDatabase` only when the proxy intentionally uses a
different database on the same Valkey endpoint and credential.

Use `gateway.envoy.service.extraPorts` to retain additional in-cluster Service
ports that target Envoy's existing listener. In particular, older service-chart
releases expose port 443 as a plaintext alias behind edge TLS termination; an
`extraPorts` entry can preserve that endpoint without enabling Envoy edge TLS.

Cookie rotation invalidates browser sessions and must not leave replicas using
different keys. Suspend the OAuth2 Proxy HPA, scale its Deployment to zero and
verify no matching nonterminal pods remain; then replace the Secret, update
`rolloutNonce`, complete the rollout, and restore autoscaling.

For upgrades from legacy OAuth values, move `secretName`, `clientSecretKey`, and
`cookieSecretKey` to the blocks above and remove `useKubernetesSecrets` and
`secretPaths`. Also remove unsupported `mountPath` fields from typed Secret
blocks; Helm schema errors identify any remaining legacy fields.

## Internal gateway TLS

`gateway.tls` protects internal Envoy-to-service traffic, not public ingress.

| Mode | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Development | `gateway.tls.generated.enabled: true` |
| Production | Set `generated.enabled: false`, `caSecret`, and every `upstreamCerts` Secret |

Generated mode uses an individually rendered Helm
`pre-install,pre-upgrade`/Argo CD `PreSync` bootstrap Job. The Job creates and
populates retained CA, trust, and leaf Secrets before the consumer Deployments
are applied. Certificate data is never rendered into Helm release state, and
the generated Secrets carry Helm keep and Argo `Prune=false,Delete=false`
metadata. Raw Helm use requires Helm 3.19 or newer for complete cleanup when a
later hook fails. Back up these Secrets; uninstalling the release does not make
the CA safe to replace.

- Rotate leaves by changing `gateway.tls.generated.leafRotationNonce`.
- For CA rotation, freeze consumer HPAs and use one unique rotation ID through `prepare`, `activate`,
  `retire`, then `stable`. Wait after every phase. Before `retire`, verify every live leaf and consumer uses the activated CA.
  Unfreeze HPAs only after `stable` completes.
- On the first upgrade from process-local TLS, set
  `gateway.tls.generated.bootstrap.allowInitialGeneration=true` once, verify the
  retained Secrets, then set it back to `false`. Never use this flag to replace
  a missing retained CA; restore the original Secret instead.
- If the bootstrap hook fails, correct the cause and rerun `helm upgrade` or
  start another Argo CD sync. Hook cleanup recreates the stable Job name; merely
  deleting an Argo hook does not start a new sync.

## Exposure

Set `externalUrl` to the public URL clients use. The gateway can be exposed in
one of these ways:

- Keep `gateway.envoy.service.type: ClusterIP` for in-cluster access.
- Set `gateway.envoy.service.type: LoadBalancer` for a load balancer Service.
- Set `ingress.enabled: true` and configure `ingress.hostname`.
- Set `httproute.enabled: true` and configure `httproute.parentRefs` for an
  existing Gateway.

For local access to the default ClusterIP Service:

```bash
kubectl --namespace osmo port-forward service/osmo-gateway 8080:80
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/version
```
