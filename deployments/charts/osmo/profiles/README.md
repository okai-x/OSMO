# OSMO chart profiles

The chart defaults provide the development quickstart. Profiles are values-file
overlays, not a `profile` value selected by the chart. Layer environment-specific
values after a base overlay so that the environment values take precedence.

| File | Directly installable | Required environment input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chart defaults (`values.yaml`) | Yes, on a development cluster | KAI Scheduler, the CloudNativePG operator, and a default dynamic StorageClass installed separately |
| `self-contained.yaml` | Yes, with production inputs | KAI Scheduler, the CloudNativePG operator, a default dynamic StorageClass, at least four schedulable nodes, a NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI, an external OIDC client and Secret with role assignments for production, a TLS edge and public `externalUrl`, and IPv4 cluster CIDRs |
| `single-plane.yaml` | Base overlay | Site-specific external PostgreSQL, Valkey, and object-storage locations; required Kubernetes Secrets for static authentication; `externalUrl`; and `compute.backendName` |
| `split-plane-control.yaml` | Base overlay | PostgreSQL, Valkey, and object-storage endpoints; Kubernetes Secrets; and `externalUrl` |
| `split-plane-compute.yaml` | Base overlay | A control-plane `externalUrl`, a compute authentication Secret, and `compute.backendName` set explicitly at install time |

The default values are the smallest complete control-and-compute deployment
for browser, CLI, and CPU hello-world verification. It exposes the UI and API
through gateway NodePort `30080` while omitting optional production behavior.
It intentionally uses `latest` OSMO images, one replica per component,
development authentication, bootstrapped service auth, and small
single-node stateful dependencies.
Chart defaults and `self-contained.yaml` are install-only profiles; both
bootstrap service auth in-cluster and must not be reused as upgrade values.
The single-plane and split profiles keep service auth external and bootstrap
disabled. The quickstart generates its other application credentials and does
not require an image-pull Secret to be created beforehand. Configure top-level
`imagePullSecrets` only when using a registry that requires credentials.

The self-contained profile is the converged path for environments that host
OSMO and its stateful dependencies in Kubernetes. It uses chart-version OSMO
images, production service defaults, a synchronous three-instance PostgreSQL
Cluster, replicated fixed-primary Valkey, four-node distributed RustFS,
semantic authorization, and network isolation. The profile creates and retains
its workflow namespace. Embedded Dex uses volatile memory storage and is
intended for development and evaluation only. Dex restarts invalidate active
sessions and signing keys. Production deployments should use
`authentication.provider: externalOidc`; the complete endpoint and
existing-Secret contract belongs in an environment values file. Production
operators must also provide and test backup and restore for the stateful
volumes and retained Secrets.

`single-plane.yaml` enables both planes with externally managed dependencies.
It is not directly installable: layer it before a site-specific values file
that supplies the required dependency locations, connection details, and public
URL. It defaults to embedded Dex, or a site can deliberately select
`authentication.provider: externalOidc` and supply the external IdP contract.
Object storage defaults to static Secret authentication;
sites using a cloud SDK identity can set
`externalDependencies.objectStorage.authentication.type: sdkDefault` instead.
The gateway is a ClusterIP and the profile creates no Ingress or HTTPRoute.
Authentication and authorization are mandatory for its control plane; sites
configure public exposure and TLS through their environment-specific overlay.
For example:

```bash
helm upgrade --install osmo deployments/charts/osmo \
  --values deployments/charts/osmo/profiles/single-plane.yaml \
  --values single-plane-azure.yaml
```

KAI Scheduler is a prerequisite for every profile that enables the compute
plane. The unified chart does not install or manage KAI. CloudNativePG must also
be installed before enabling the embedded PostgreSQL Cluster.
