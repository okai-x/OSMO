# OSMO Workflow Troubleshooting

Catalog of common failure modes for OSMO workflows. Each entry has:
- **Signature** — what you'll see in logs, status, or events
- **Diagnosis** — what it means in plain language
- **Fix** — concrete recipe to resolve

Always start by running the standard status workflow in
`references/workflow-status.md` first (`osmo workflow query` + logs and/or
events) so the cached JSON is available for diagnosis.

## Debug a Failed or Stuck Workflow

Use when the user asks why a workflow failed, why it is stuck, or how to fix an
OSMO error. If they want automatic fix-and-resubmit, use the end-to-end
orchestration flow in `references/workflow-status.md` instead.

1. Establish current state with `references/workflow-status.md`; cache the
   query JSON.
2. Match the symptom below by status, exit code, error keyword, log signature,
   or behavior.
3. Explain the likely root cause in plain language, avoiding raw Kubernetes
   jargon when possible.
4. Recommend a concrete fix from the matched pattern. If the fix edits
   `workflow.yaml`, show the exact diff you would apply.
5. Ask before applying the fix and resubmitting unless the user has already
   authorized autonomous fix-and-resubmit.

Escalate to the user when the symptom does not match any troubleshooting
pattern, or when the same workflow has already failed after three fix attempts.

## Retry a Failed or Canceled Workflow

After establishing the failure cause:

- When the user asks to run a failed or `FAILED_CANCELED` workflow again
  as-is and there is no deterministic problem to fix, run:
  ```bash
  osmo workflow restart <workflow_id>
  ```
- When the failure is deterministic, diagnose and fix the local workflow YAML,
  validate it, then resubmit the corrected file with:
  ```bash
  osmo workflow submit <workflow_file>
  ```
- `osmo workflow submit <workflow_id>` starts a new full run from the saved
  spec. Use it only when the user explicitly asks for that, rather than as the
  normal failed-workflow retry.

---

## Status: PENDING for an unusually long time

### Signature
- `osmo workflow query` shows `status: PENDING`, `start_time: null`.
- `osmo workflow events` shows repeated `FailedScheduling` or `Unschedulable` lines
  with phrases like `Insufficient nvidia.com/gpu`, `didn't have enough resources:
  GPUs`, or `didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector`.

### Diagnosis flow
Run these in order so you have the full picture before explaining:

1. `osmo workflow query <workflow_id>` — confirm status is PENDING and grab the
   pool.
2. `osmo workflow events <workflow_id>` — surface the scheduler's reason
   (`FailedScheduling`, `Unschedulable`, etc.).
3. `osmo workflow spec <workflow_id>` — read the resource request (GPUs / CPU /
   memory per task, replica count).
4. `osmo resource list` (or `osmo resource list -p <pool>`) — inspect per-node
   available capacity in the target pool.
5. Synthesize a plain-language explanation by comparing the spec's ask to what's
   actually free on a single node.

### Diagnosis
The Kubernetes scheduler can't find a node that satisfies the workflow's resource
request. Two distinct causes look similar in events:

- **Quota exhausted, capacity available** — the user's quota in this pool is fully
  used, but other users' quota or the physical pool still has free GPUs.
- **Capacity exhausted** — every node in the pool has its GPUs/CPU/memory consumed
  by other workloads, or the per-task ask exceeds any single node's free capacity.

Distinguish by combining `osmo pool list` and `osmo resource list`:
- If `Quota Free = 0` but `Total Free > 0` → quota issue.
- If `Total Free = 0` (or close) across the pool → pool-level capacity issue.
- If pool has free GPUs but no single node has enough free for the per-task ask
  → per-node capacity mismatch (e.g. workflow asks for 8 GPUs/node but every node
  only has 4 free).

### Fix
- **Quota issue**: resubmit with `--priority LOW` to bypass quota and run on idle
  capacity. LOW jobs may be preempted when quota holders need GPUs — explain that to
  the user.
- **Capacity issue**: `--priority LOW` will not help. Options:
  - Wait for capacity to free up (queue will schedule automatically).
  - Cancel and resubmit to a different pool with free GPUs (`osmo pool list --mode
    free` to compare).
  - Reduce the GPU request if the workflow's per-task GPU count exceeds what any
    single node currently has free.

## Exit code 137 (OOM kill)

### Signature
- Logs end abruptly, often mid-step.
- `osmo workflow query` shows the failed task with `exit_code: 137` and possibly a
  `failure_message` mentioning OOMKilled.
- Events for the pod include `OOMKilled` or `Reason: OOMKilled`.

### Diagnosis
The container exceeded its memory limit and the kernel killed it. Plain language:
"the workflow ran out of memory."

### Fix
- Increase the `memory` value in `resources.default` in `workflow.yaml`. Start by
  doubling it; if the workload's peak memory is known, set it ~20% above that peak.
- If memory is already at the node's cap, reduce per-task work (smaller batch size,
  fewer parallel workers, smaller chunks of input data) so peak usage drops.
- Validate the new memory value against `references/validation-error-recovery.md`
  sizing rules before submitting.

---

## Exit code 139 (segfault)

### Signature
- `exit_code: 139` on the failed task.
- Logs may show a stack trace or end abruptly with no error message.

### Diagnosis
The process received SIGSEGV — usually a native code crash (CUDA driver/library
mismatch, broken C extension, hardware fault, or an uncaught native exception).

### Fix
- Check that the container image's CUDA / cuDNN / NCCL versions match the GPU
  driver on the node (e.g. driver version visible in `nvidia-smi` output if the
  script logs it).
- If using a custom image, rebuild with versions known to work on the target nodes.
- If it's a transient hardware issue, restart once — repeated segfaults on the
  same node may indicate a bad GPU; ask the user to file a ticket with the node
  name and timestamp.

---

## Exit code 143 (SIGTERM)

### Signature
- `exit_code: 143`.
- Logs include `Killing: Stopping container <name>` from the kubelet.
- Workflow status often `FAILED_CANCELED` rather than `FAILED`.

### Diagnosis
The pod received SIGTERM — typically from cancellation, preemption (LOW priority
workloads), or a node going into maintenance.

### Fix
- If the user cancelled, no fix needed.
- If `--priority LOW` was used, expect occasional preemption — resubmit at NORMAL
  priority once quota is available, or accept the preemption risk.
- If neither — check `osmo workflow events` for node maintenance or eviction
  reasons, and ask the user to restart the workflow.

---

## Exit code 127 (command not found)

### Signature
- `exit_code: 127`.
- Logs show `<command>: command not found` near the end (e.g. `jq: command not
  found`, `python: command not found`).

### Diagnosis
The entry script invoked a binary that isn't in the container image's PATH. Common
victims: `jq`, `git`, `curl`, `wget`, language runtimes, `gcloud`/`aws`/`az` CLIs.

### Fix
- Add an install step at the top of the entry script, e.g.:
  ```bash
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y jq
  ```
  (Adjust for the distro: `apk add` for Alpine, `dnf install` for RHEL family.)
- Or rewrite the script to use a tool that's already in the image (e.g. pure bash
  in place of `jq`, `python -m json.tool` if Python is present).
- Or switch to a base image that includes the missing tool.

---

## ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull

### Signature
- Pod stuck before any user logs appear.
- Events show `Failed to pull image "<image>"` with reasons like `not found`,
  `unauthorized`, `denied`, or `manifest unknown`.

### Diagnosis
The container runtime cannot fetch the image:
- **Bad tag or path** — image name or tag doesn't exist in the registry.
- **Auth failure** — the workflow is missing an OSMO registry credential, the
  YAML does not reference it, or the credential payload is wrong.
- **Registry outage** — transient network or registry-side issue.

### Fix
- Verify the image exists at that exact tag (e.g. `docker pull <image>` from a
  workstation with the same credentials).
- If using a private registry for a workflow image, read
  `references/workflow-credentials.md`; check or create the `REGISTRY`
  credential for the registry host. Do not try to fix image pulls by adding
  task-level `credentials:` YAML.
- For transient issues, restart once. If it keeps failing, switch to a known-good
  image as a smoke test before debugging further.

---

## Init container failure (Init:CrashLoopBackOff)

### Signature
- Pod shows `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` or `Init:Error` in events.
- Container `osmo-init` (or similar) appears in events with non-zero exit.
- User's task logs are empty because the user container never started.

### Diagnosis
OSMO uses an init container to set up the workflow environment (download inputs,
prepare mounts). If init fails, the user task never runs.

### Fix
- Common init failures:
  - **Input storage path missing or wrong** — verify the task's `inputs` block
    points to a valid upstream task output or object storage URL.
  - **Storage backend auth** — credentials for the pool's storage backend may be
    misconfigured; this is an admin issue, ask the user to file a ticket.
  - **Network/permission issue** — events usually carry the underlying error.
- Read the init container's logs explicitly:
  ```
  osmo workflow logs <id> --task <task_name> -n 10000
  ```

## NCCL / multi-GPU communication timeout

### Signature
- Logs include `NCCL` errors, `nccl timeout`, `socketStartConnect`, or
  `IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR`.
- Multi-GPU training that worked at smaller scale fails at larger scale.

### Diagnosis
Inter-GPU communication is broken or too slow. Possible causes:
- Pods landed on nodes that aren't in the same fast-network domain (no shared
  RDMA / InfiniBand fabric).
- Network plugin misconfiguration on the cluster.
- Specific NCCL version incompatibility with the GPU/driver combination.

### Fix
- For pod placement, start with `references/workflow-patterns.md`, then follow
  its topology guidance to `references/workflow-advanced-patterns.md`.
- Set NCCL env vars in the workflow's `environment:` block to debug:
  - `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` (verbose logging)
  - `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0` (force a specific interface)
- If suspected version issue, pin a known-working NCCL version in the image.
- For RDMA-specific failures, the cluster may need admin attention.

---

## Output data missing after COMPLETED

### Signature
- Workflow status `COMPLETED`, exit code `0`.
- The output location listed in the workflow spec exists but is empty, or the
  expected files aren't there.
- Common: the entry script created a directory like `{{outputs}}` or `output` as a
  literal name on the local filesystem instead of writing to the OSMO-mounted
  output path.

### Diagnosis
The script didn't write to the OSMO output mount. The workflow's `outputs` are
declared via the task's `outputs` block, and the script is expected to write into the
path indicated by the placeholder `{{output}}` (singular).

### Fix
- Audit the entry script for the placeholder. **The correct token is `{{output}}`
  (singular).** A common typo is `{{outputs}}` (plural) — that string is not
  substituted by OSMO at runtime, so the script ends up with a literal directory
  named `{{outputs}}` on local disk that's never uploaded.
- After fixing the placeholder, rerun. Output upload happens at task completion;
  watch `osmo workflow query` for `output_upload_start_time` to confirm.

---

## Validation error at submission time

### Signature
- `osmo workflow submit` returns a non-zero exit and prints a validation error
  table — typically resource-related, listing each task's requested values vs node
  capacity.

### Diagnosis
The cluster rejected the submission before the workflow ever started a pod. The
requested resources exceed what any node in the chosen pool can offer.

### Fix
- See `references/validation-error-recovery.md` for the sizing rules to apply.
- Adjust the hard-coded values in `workflow.yaml`'s `resources` block per the
  rules, then resubmit.
- Do not modify Jinja template variables (`{{num_gpu}}`, etc.) — those are
  resolved at runtime via `--set`.

---

## Logs are empty or sparse

### Signature
- `osmo workflow logs <id>` returns nothing or only container-startup banners.

### Diagnosis
- The workflow may still be in container startup (image pulling, init container
  running) — fetch events instead.
- Or the user's script may be producing stdout that's buffered and not yet
  flushed.
- Or this is a multi-task workflow and logs need to be fetched per-task.

### Fix
- For multi-task workflows, use `--task <task_name>` per task, or delegate to the
  `logs-reader` subagent (see `references/logs-reader.md`).
- For buffered output, suggest the user add `python -u` (unbuffered) for Python
  scripts, or `stdbuf -oL` for general commands, in their entry script.
- If logs are truly empty, check pod events for what's blocking (image pull,
  scheduling, init failure).

## How to add a pattern to this catalog

When you see a new failure pattern in the wild that you had to figure out by hand,
add a section here with the same shape: **Signature / Diagnosis / Fix**. Keep
diagnoses in plain language, and keep fixes concrete enough that the next agent
can apply them mechanically.
