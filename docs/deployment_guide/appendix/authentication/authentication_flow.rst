Authentication Flow
================================================

This guide describes how authentication and authorization work in OSMO: how users and service accounts prove their identity and how OSMO determines what they are allowed to do.

.. important::

   Control-plane releases of the unified ``osmo`` chart always use OIDC:
   embedded Dex by default or an explicit external provider. Embedded Dex is
   routed at ``<externalUrl>/dex``. Each configured local identity receives the
   roles declared in ``authentication.bootstrap.identities``; the default
   ``admin`` identity receives ``osmo-admin``. The no-IdP/default-access-token
   flow below applies to other deployment paths; see
   :doc:`migrating_to_embedded_dex`.

Architecture components
========================

The main pieces involved are:

1. **User or client** — A person (browser or CLI) or a script/automation that wants to call OSMO. They must present something that proves their identity: either a JWT (from an IdP or from OSMO) or a access token.

2. **Envoy** — The API gateway in front of the OSMO service. It can be configured to:
   - **With an IdP:** Run an OAuth2 filter that redirects unauthenticated browser users to your identity provider and validates the JWT returned by the IdP. It then forwards the request to the OSMO service with headers like ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` derived from the JWT.
   - **Without an IdP:** Allow requests that carry a valid access token or service-issued JWT and set the same headers for the backend.

3. **Identity provider (IdP)** — Optional. Your organization's login system (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Google, AWS IAM Identity Center). When used, Envoy talks to it directly and the IdP issues JWTs that Envoy validates.

4. **OSMO service** — The backend. It trusts the ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` headers set by Envoy (or by an internal path that bypasses Envoy). It does **not** validate the original JWT itself; Envoy is responsible for that. The service uses the user and roles to resolve policies and allow or deny the request.

So in practice: the client gets a token (JWT from IdP or access token), Envoy validates it and sets user/roles headers, and the OSMO service authorizes based on those headers and its role/policy database.

Operating without an identity provider
=========================================

When you do not configure an IdP, there is no browser "log in with SSO" flow. Access is token-based.

Default admin
--------------

You enable a **default admin** user via Helm (see :ref:`default_admin_setup`). On startup, the OSMO service:

- Creates a user with the configured username (e.g. ``admin``).
- Assigns that user the ``osmo-admin`` role.
- Creates an access token for that user whose secret is the password you stored in a Kubernetes secret.

So the "password" you set for the default admin is effectively the access token value. Use it with
the CLI via ``osmo login <url> --method token --token '<that-password>'``, or with the API as
``Authorization: Bearer <that-password>``.

Access tokens
-------------

After the default admin is in place (or if you have another admin), you can:

- Create more **users** via the CLI (e.g. ``osmo user create``).
- Assign **roles** to users (e.g. ``osmo user roles add <user_id> <role_name>``).
- Create **access tokens** for users (e.g. ``osmo token create <token_name>``). An admin can create a token for another user via ``osmo token create <token_name> --user <user_id>``. Each access token is tied to a user and gets a set of roles (by default, all of that user's roles) at creation time.

Scripts and the CLI then authenticate by sending the access token in the ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` header. The OSMO service (or Envoy, if configured to accept access tokens) validates the token, resolves the user and roles from the database, and sets the same ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` headers for the backend. Authorization works the same as for IdP-issued JWTs.

Token-based login (service-issued JWT)
--------------------------------------

For compatibility with flows that expect a JWT (e.g. some CLI or internal callers), OSMO can issue its own JWTs.
A client exchanges an access token for a short-lived JWT by POSTing to ``/api/auth/jwt/access_token``.
Envoy must be configured to accept JWTs issued by OSMO (e.g. via ``osmoauth`` and the service's public key).

.. note::

   In ``POST /api/auth/jwt/access_token``, ``access_token`` names the token type being exchanged, not the body field. The body field is ``token``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -X POST "$GATEWAY/api/auth/jwt/access_token" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"token":"<access-token-value>"}'

Operating with an identity provider
===================================

When you configure an IdP, Envoy uses OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect to let users log in with your organization's identity system.

Browser login
-------------

1. The user opens the OSMO UI or an API URL that requires authentication.
2. Envoy asks OAuth2 Proxy to validate the browser's session cookie. With no valid session, OAuth2
   Proxy redirects the browser to the IdP's authorization endpoint.
3. The user signs in at the IdP (e.g. Microsoft or Google).
4. The IdP redirects back with an authorization code to ``https://<your-domain>/oauth2/callback``.
5. OAuth2 Proxy exchanges the code for tokens at the IdP's token endpoint and establishes its
   session cookie.
6. On subsequent requests, Envoy asks OAuth2 Proxy to validate the cookie. OAuth2 Proxy returns the
   ID token in the ``Authorization`` header.
7. Envoy validates the ID token (signature, expiry, issuer, and audience) and sets ``x-osmo-user``
   and ``x-osmo-roles`` from its claims.
8. The OSMO service receives the request with those headers and authorizes it using its role and
   policy database.

So the IdP is the source of "who is this?"; OSMO is the source of "what can they do?" (roles and policies), possibly combined with role information from the IdP (e.g. groups mapped to OSMO roles).

CLI login
---------

For the CLI, use ``osmo login`` to authenticate with an IdP. Authorization code flow with PKCE is
the default. Use ``osmo login --method code`` to use device authorization instead. The PKCE flow
opens the system browser and receives the authorization response on a temporary loopback listener.
It uses an ``S256`` code challenge plus ``state`` and OpenID Connect ``nonce`` validation, and does
not use a client secret.

For Microsoft Entra ID, add ``http://localhost`` under the app registration's **Mobile and desktop
applications** platform and enable public client flows. Existing web and implicit-flow settings are
independent and do not need to be changed. In particular, enabling ID tokens under **Implicit grant
and hybrid flows** is not a replacement for delegated permissions and is not used by the CLI's PKCE
token exchange. Do not disable an existing implicit or hybrid-flow setting as part of enabling PKCE.

The CLI requests the standard OpenID Connect ``openid``, ``profile``, and ``offline_access`` scopes,
then uses the returned ID token for OSMO API requests to preserve the same gateway contract as
device authorization. The current flow does not request Microsoft Graph or an OSMO API scope, so do
not add a delegated API permission solely for CLI sign-in. Add delegated permissions only when the
client actually calls the protected API represented by that scope.

Role resolution with an IdP
---------------------------

When a request carries an IdP-issued JWT:

1. Envoy validates the JWT and extracts a user identifier (e.g. ``preferred_username`` or ``email``) and, if present, group/role claims.
2. The OSMO service (or middleware) may **sync** the user and roles:
   - Ensure the user exists in OSMO (just-in-time provisioning).
   - Map IdP group/role claims to OSMO role names (via :ref:`idp_role_mapping`).
   - Merge roles from the IdP with roles stored in OSMO's ``user_roles`` table and apply role ``sync_mode`` (e.g. ``import`` vs ``force``).
3. The final list of roles for the request is used to load policies and allow or deny the action.

So roles can come from the IdP (mapped into OSMO role names) and/or from OSMO's user/role tables. See the :doc:`idp_role_mapping` for details.

Token validation and headers
============================

Envoy (or the component in front of the OSMO service) is responsible for:

- **Signature verification** — The JWT was signed by the expected IdP or by OSMO.
- **Expiration** — The token is not expired.
- **Claims** — ``iss`` (issuer), ``aud`` (audience), and the claim used as username (e.g. ``preferred_username``, ``email``) match the configuration.

The OSMO service does **not** validate the raw JWT. It trusts the ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` headers. Therefore, in production you must only expose the OSMO service through Envoy (or another gateway) that:

- Validates the JWT or access token.
- Strips or ignores any downstream ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` from the client.
- Sets ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` from the validated token.

Troubleshooting
===============

**User cannot log in (with IdP)**
Verify IdP configuration (redirect URIs, client ID/secret), Envoy OAuth2 and JWT provider settings (issuer, audience, JWKS URI), and that the IdP is reachable from the cluster.

**User has no permissions (403)**
Check that the user has roles in OSMO (via ``osmo user get <user_id>`` or IdP mapping). Verify ``x-osmo-user`` and ``x-osmo-roles`` in Envoy logs. Ensure the role has policies that allow the requested action (see :doc:`roles_policies`).

**Token validation failures**
Ensure issuer and audience in Envoy match the JWT. Check JWKS URI connectivity from Envoy. For access tokens, ensure the token exists and is not expired.
