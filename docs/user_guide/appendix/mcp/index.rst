MCP
===

MCP is an optional, self-hosted
`Model Context Protocol <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/>`_ service for OSMO
deployments. It gives compatible AI clients a structured way to inspect and
operate an OSMO deployment over HTTPS.

MCP exposes a curated set of OSMO operations. It does not replace the OSMO CLI.

.. important::

   MCP must be enabled by the administrator of your OSMO deployment. There is
   no universal MCP URL; the endpoint normally has the form
   ``https://<osmo-host>/mcp``.

   To connect a client, see :ref:`getting_started_mcp`.

.. _mcp_identity_permissions:

Identity and Permissions
========================

MCP uses the signed-in user's existing OSMO access. Users have the same roles,
accessible pools, and API permissions as when they use OSMO through the CLI.
MCP does not grant additional access or elevate permissions.

Connect with the deployment's MCP URL and complete browser sign-in as
described in :ref:`getting_started_mcp`.

Successful login does not authorize every tool. Each tool's OSMO API request
is checked separately. Workflow operations are authorized
against the owning or target pool, so a user can connect to MCP and inspect a
profile while still being unable to submit to a restricted pool.

Common permission requirements are summarized below. The receiving OSMO API
remains authoritative.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 32 68

   * - Tool area
     - Typical OSMO actions
   * - Health and profile
     - ``profile:Read`` for health and profile inspection;
       ``profile:Update`` for supported profile changes.
   * - Pools and resources
     - ``profile:Read`` plus ``pool:List`` for pool search, or
       ``profile:Read`` plus ``resources:Read`` for resource inspection.
   * - Workflow inspection
     - ``profile:Read`` plus ``workflow:List`` for workflow and task lists, and
       ``workflow:Read`` for workflow details, logs, events, and
       specifications.
   * - Workflow actions
     - Pool-scoped ``workflow:Create`` for validation and submission;
       omitting the pool also requires ``profile:Read``. Cancellation requires
       ``workflow:Cancel``. Restart also reads the source workflow and creates
       a workflow in the target pool.
   * - Applications
     - ``app:Read`` for inspection; ``app:Create`` for create and rename;
       ``app:Update`` for update; and ``app:Delete`` for deletion. Application
       submission requires ``app:Read`` plus pool-scoped ``workflow:Create``,
       and also ``profile:Read`` when the pool is omitted.
   * - Credentials
     - ``credentials:Read`` for metadata and ``credentials:Delete`` for
       deletion. MCP never returns secret payloads.

MCP and the OSMO Agent Skill
============================

MCP and the OSMO Agent Skill are complementary ways to use OSMO from an
AI client.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 38 38

   * - Characteristic
     - MCP
     - OSMO Agent Skill
   * - Access path
     - Remote HTTPS tools exposed by the OSMO deployment
     - Local ``osmo`` CLI commands run by the agent
   * - Authentication
     - The MCP client's OAuth session
     - The local CLI session created by ``osmo login``
   * - Local requirement
     - A compatible MCP client; the OSMO CLI is not required
     - The OSMO CLI must be installed and authenticated
   * - Surface
     - A fixed, bounded set of supported tools
     - The broader CLI workflows permitted by the skill
   * - Best suited for
     - Structured remote access with typed inputs and results
     - CLI-oriented work involving local files or capabilities outside MCP

See :doc:`Install Client <../../getting_started/install/index>` for Agent Skill
installation.

Capabilities
============

The self-hosted MCP groups tools into the following areas:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Area
     - Supported operations
   * - Health and profile
     - Verify caller-bound access; read profile identity, settings, roles, and
       accessible pools; update supported profile settings.
   * - Pools and resources
     - Search accessible pools and inspect bounded node capacity, usage, and
       availability.
   * - Workflows
     - List workflows; inspect status, logs, events, and specifications;
       filter and inspect workflow labels; validate or submit label overrides;
       inspect label-policy warnings; restart and cancel workflows.
   * - Tasks
     - List tasks on named nodes within accessible pools, filtered by status or
       priority. Lists default to your tasks; ``all_users=true`` includes other
       users' tasks within that scope.
   * - Applications
     - List applications; inspect metadata, versions, and specifications; create,
       update, delete, rename, and submit applications.
   * - Credentials
     - List credential names and types or delete a credential. Secret payloads
       are never returned by MCP.

The server advertises the exact current tool names, input definitions, and
annotations to the MCP client.

Safety and Limits
=================

MCP deliberately exposes a smaller surface than the CLI:

* Every tool maps to a fixed OSMO API method and route. Tool input cannot select
  an alternate server, route, method, identity, token, or HTTP headers.
* Results are validated and bounded. Long logs or specifications can return a
  marked truncated prefix.
* Tool annotations distinguish read-only operations from state-changing and
  destructive operations.
* Workflow submission and restart consume real compute. Cancellation and
  deletion might not be reversible.
* State-changing operations are not automatically retried. If an error leaves
  the result uncertain, inspect OSMO state before retrying.
* Workflow validation is not completely side-effect free: a failed validation
  can create a ``FAILED_SUBMISSION`` record.
* Credential tools never accept or return secret payloads. Mutation responses
  do not echo newly submitted specifications, and MCP does not log them. Read
  tools can return bounded, redacted stored specifications. The calling client
  can retain mutation arguments in its transcript or logs, so reference OSMO
  credentials instead of embedding secrets in workflow or application YAML.
* Application descriptions can appear in service access logs and must not
  contain secrets.
* Workflow label overrides can appear in service access logs and must not
  contain secrets.

Capabilities Not Exposed
========================

The self-hosted MCP does not expose:

* OSMO CLI login, logout, or OSMO access-token management as MCP tools (the
  calling client can still manage its own MCP OAuth session);
* credential creation or replacement;
* local file expansion or data upload and download;
* workflow exec, port forwarding, or rsync;
* privileged user, backend, role, or service-configuration administration; or
* arbitrary access to OSMO REST routes.

Use the :ref:`CLI Reference <cli_reference>` or the OSMO Agent Skill when one
of these capabilities is required.

   * :ref:`getting_started_mcp` for client configuration and connection
     verification.
   * :doc:`Install Client <../../getting_started/install/index>` for the OSMO
     CLI and Agent Skill.
   * :ref:`mcp_deployment` for enabling MCP in a self-hosted OSMO
     deployment.
