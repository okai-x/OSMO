Setup Credentials
=================

Credentials are secrets required to run workflows or perform data operations in OSMO.

OSMO supports the following types of credentials:

* :ref:`Registry <credentials_registry>` - for accessing private container registries where Docker images are stored
* :ref:`Data <credentials_data>` - for accessing data storage solutions to read/write data in your workflows
* :ref:`Generic <credentials_generic>` - for storing and dereferencing generic key value pairs in the workflows

.. _credentials_registry:

Registry
========

.. hint::

   If you are using **public** container registries, you can skip this step.

.. important::

   If you are using a private container registry, you are **required** to
   set up registry credentials in order to pull container images for your workflows.

    .. tab-item:: NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)

        .. dropdown:: What is NGC?
            :color: primary
            :icon: question

            `NVIDIA GPU Cloud <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com>`__ (NGC) is an online catalog of GPU accelerated
            cloud applications (docker containers, helm charts, and models). It also provides **private
            registries** for teams to upload their own docker containers.

            Follow NVIDIA's `personal API key guide
            <https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/latest/ngc-user-guide.html#generating-a-personal-api-key>`__
            to generate a personal API Key. In the ``Services Included*`` drop down,
            select ``Private Registry``.

            .. important::

                Please make sure to save your API key to a file, it will never be displayed to you
                again. If you lose your API key, you can always generate a new one, but the old one will
                be invalidated, and applications will have to be re-authenticated.

        To setup a registry credential for NGC, run the following command with your NGC API key:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ osmo credential set my-ngc-cred \
                    --type REGISTRY \
                    --payload registry=nvcr.io \

.. _credentials_data:

Data
====

OSMO integrates with the following data storage solutions:

.. auto-include:: supported_storage.in.rst

To access your data storage within workflows, you'll need to set the appropriate credentials.

.. important::

    For assistance with **creating credentials** for your data storage provider, please
    contact your OSMO administrator.

.. tab-set::

    .. auto-include:: data_credentials_examples.in.rst

    .. tab-item:: S3 / S3-Compatible

        To set a credential for S3 or S3-compatible storage, run the following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ osmo credential set my-s3-cred \
                --type DATA \
                --payload \
                endpoint=s3://<bucket> \
                region=<region> \
                access_key_id=<access_key_id> \
                access_key=<access_key> \
                override_url=<http_endpoint>  # Optional: required for non-AWS S3

        .. note::

            ``override_url`` is only required for non-AWS S3-compatible services such as MinIO, Ceph,
            and LocalStack. It specifies the HTTP endpoint of the service (e.g., ``http://minio:9000``).
            Omit it for standard AWS S3.

        .. seealso::

            Please refer to `AWS Access Key Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-key-self-managed.html>`_

        .. seealso::

            Please refer to `GCS HMAC Keys Documentation <https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys#console>`_

            - ``region`` → **OPTIONAL** (defaults to ``eastus``)

        .. seealso::

            Please refer to `Azure Storage Connection String Documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string>`_

            - ``access_key`` → **Secret Access Key (SK)** in TOS
            - ``region`` → **Region** in TOS (e.g. ``cn-beijing``, ``cn-shanghai``, etc.)

        .. seealso::

           Please refer to `TOS Access Keys Documentation <https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-creating-an-accesskey>`_
           for additional information on managing access keys.

.. _credentials_generic:

Generic Secrets
===============

Any other secrets unrelated to registry and data can be stored as generic credentials (``type=GENERIC``).

For example, to access the Omniverse Nucleus server:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo credential set omni-auth \
        --type GENERIC \
        --payload omni_user='$omni-api-token' \
        omni_pass=<token>

Another example is to access Weights and Biases (W&B) for logging and tracking your experiments:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo credential set wb-auth \
        --type GENERIC \
        --payload wb_api_key=<api_key>

.. seealso::

  Your registry and data credentials are picked up automatically when you submit a workflow.
  To specify a generic credential in the workflow, refer to :ref:`workflow_spec_secrets`.

.. _credentials_cli:

CLI Reference
=============

.. seealso::

   See :ref:`cli_reference_credential` for the full CLI reference for ``osmo credential``.
