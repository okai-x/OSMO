/**
 * Visual lifecycle stages for the progress bar.

 * These split the K8s Pending phase into two visual sub-stages for clarity:
 *
 *   scheduling -> K8s "Pending" phase, scheduling sub-phase
 *                 (waiting for PodScheduled condition)
 *   init       -> K8s "Pending" phase, initialization sub-phase
 *                 (PodReadyToStartContainers, image pull, init containers,
 *                  container creation -- everything between scheduling and running)
 *   running    -> K8s "Running" phase
 *                 (at least one container started)
 *   done       -> K8s "Succeeded" or "Failed" phase (terminal)
 *
 * Transition points:
 *   scheduling -> init:    When "Scheduled" event appears (PodScheduled=True)
 *   init -> running:       When "Started" event appears (phase transitions to Running)
 *   running -> done:       When all containers terminate (Succeeded or Failed)

 * Get progress index (0-3) from the derived furthest progress.

 * Maps the K8s pod lifecycle to our 4 visual stages:
 *   0 = Scheduling         -- waiting for node assignment
 *   1 = Init (initialization) -- scheduled, pulling images, creating containers
 *   2 = Running               -- at least one container executing
 *   3 = Done                  -- terminal state (Succeeded or Failed)
 *
 * Uses `furthestProgressIndex` from the derived state, which scans ALL events
 * for the highest stage reached. This is robust to:
 * - Missing events: a "Running" event without "Scheduling"/"Init" events still
 *   shows the task at the Running stage (and infers earlier stages).
 * - Out-of-order events: a late "Scheduling" event after "Running" does not
 *   regress the progress.

 * - active: task currently progressing through the running stage
 * - terminal: parent stopped while the race condition was unresolved — must
 *   preserve the "Pending" label rather than reverting to the static "Running"
